# Writing Readable Git Commits

Your tip content goes here in Markdown format...

## Examples

\`\`\`bash
# Good commit

\`\`\`

More content...
```

## Development Setup

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dev-toolbox.git
cd dev-toolbox

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run validation
npm run validate

# Check links
npm run check:links

# Build project
npm run build
```

## Data Validation

We use automated validation to ensure data quality:

### Schema Validation
- Tools must match `schemas/tool.schema.json`
- Tips must match `schemas/tip.frontmatter.schema.json`
- Categories must be from the approved list

### Automated Checks
- **Duplicate IDs**: No two items can have the same ID
- **Filename matching**: File names must match the ID field
- **Link validation**: External links are checked for availability
- **Required fields**: All mandatory fields must be present

### Running Validation

```bash
# Validate all data
npm run validate

# Check external links
npm run check:links

# Run complete pre-commit checks
npm run precommit
```

## Style Guidelines

### JSON Files (Tools)
- Use consistent formatting (2-space indentation)
- Keep summaries under 200 characters
- Use descriptive tags
- Include working links only

### Markdown Files (Tips)
- Use clear headings and structure
- Include practical code examples
- Test all code snippets
- Keep explanations beginner-friendly

### General Guidelines
- Write for beginners when possible
- Include real-world examples
- Keep content focused and actionable
- Use inclusive language

## Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: CI runs validation, link checking, and builds
2. **Manual Review**: Maintainers review for quality and relevance
3. **Feedback**: We may suggest improvements or ask questions
4. **Approval**: Once approved, your contribution will be merged
5. **Deployment**: Changes are automatically deployed to the live site
